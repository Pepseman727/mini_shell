### Simple mini-shell for Linux

### Roadmap
Minimal functional (MVP):  
✅ Parse commands to args(strtok())  
✅ Create child process (fork()) and execute command (execvp())  
✅ Waiting for completion (waitpid())  

Additional functional:  
✅ Processing multiple commands in a line (ls; pwd; whoami)  
✅ Background processes support (&)  
✅ Signal processing (Ctrl+C, Ctrl+Z)

Advanced level:  
🔹 Pipe support (|)  
🔹 I/O redirect (>, <, >>)  
Own commands:
    cd
✅ exit
    history
